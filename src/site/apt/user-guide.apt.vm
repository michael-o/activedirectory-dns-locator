User Guide

  To make use of this library you must run at least Java $context.get("maven.compiler.target").

  This site will guide you through the components of this library:

  [[1]] {{{./activedirectorydnslocator.html}<<<ActiveDirectoryDnsLocator>>>}}: the main component
        itself for locating <<<HostPost>>> objects with the ease of a builder.

  [[2]] {{{./activedirectoryldapdnsprovider.html}<<<ActiveDirectoryLdapDnsProvider>>>}}:
        an implementation for the {{{https://github.com/openjdk/jdk8u/blob/4a4236a366eeb961baf157f0938634c1647c447f/jdk/src/share/classes/com/sun/jndi/ldap/spi/LdapDnsProvider.java}<<<LdapDnsProvider>>>}} which wraps the locator from above and plugs into the
        JNDI/LDAP Service Provider.

  []

  Before using this library, make sure that the artifact is in the class path of your application or
  servlet container, e.g., your Tomcat instance, i.e., in <<<$CATALINA_BASE/lib>>> or <<<$CATALINA_HOME/lib>>>.
